You are playing a game. You are given small wooden tiles, each with a sign on it, e.g:


Given two ordered sets of tiles, the game is to find the cheapest way to transform the first set into the second, e.g.

The possible operations are:

Add a new tile (from the set of all tiles)
Remove a tile
Exchange the current tile with any other tile (from the set of all tiles)
Each operation has a different price, e.g. adding a new tile in a place costs 1, removing a tile from its place costs 3, and replacing one tile with another costs 2, like in the following examples:


 
Figure 1: Example of adding a  tile, costing 1.

Depending on the price, sometimes it could be cheaper to remove one tile and add another, instead of exchanging them.


 
Figure 2: Example of deleting a  tile, costing 3.

 
Figure 3: Example of replacing a   tile with a  tile, costing 2.

Input and output are received fromt the standard input and output streams.


Input Two ordered set of tiles represented as UTF-8 characters, and a comma-separated list of prices in the following order: adding price, deleting price, swapping price, e.g.


 
Figure 4: Example input arguments for the game

For this input, the minimal price is to remove the  tile, and replacing the  tile with the  tile, thus costing 5 in total: 3 for removing the  and 2 for replacing the  tile with the  tile.


Output Integer representing the minimal cost found.
