Challenge 14: Colors Are Beautiful
_________________________________________________________________________
We are pretty sure you have seen this image before. It is time to take a closer look at it… hmmmm…
lots of blue… But there are also lots of others, as you are seeing a 24 bit color image. And to get
those, every pixel has some information about the red, green and blue components in it. Given a line
of pixels in the image and a component color (RGB), you should compute the sum of that component for
every pixel in the line + 1. In decimal.
